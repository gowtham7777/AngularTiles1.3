--docker setup in windows 

Docker installation, Building and running Angular App. 

Used Windows 7 Professional. These instructions vary based on OS. 
For Windows 7: download Docker Toolbox which comes with 
Docker client(to run docker engine, creating images and containers)
Docker Machine(to create docker hosts on local mac/windows)
Docker Compose(running multi-container Docker applications)
VirtualBox
Kinematic (Docker GUI)


After installation, run docker-quick-start. Â 
 
If you see the above ssh command error: installation is not successful, after some research I changed the windows 7 virtualization property in BIOS. This may vary by OS.
Press F1 on system boot, 
Under Security->System Security-> Virtualization-technology  disabled>enabled
Save & Exit 
run docker-quick-start  again. Able to see the machine with IP address. 
 
Create a angular or Java application with DockerFile in root folder. Docker file specifies the order of execution of command to assemble an image. 
  
Building the Docker Image: app is name of the image. It executes the steps(1/7) in dockerfile.

Running multiple applications like tms-api-gateway, auth-server eureka requires compose.
